# A Simple Raycasting Demo
Inspired by old-school games such as Wolfenstein 3D, I decided to create this project out of love for these properties.

The triginometry to make this can all be found on this desmos visualization I made while developing this project: https://www.desmos.com/calculator/la1mrhklfy
