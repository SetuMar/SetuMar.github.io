# Raycasting Demo
Inspired by old-school games such as Wolfenstein 3D, I decided to create this project out of love for this property and my interest in both computer graphics and video games.

The triginometry to make this can all be found on this desmos visualization I made while developing this project: https://www.desmos.com/calculator/la1mrhklfy
